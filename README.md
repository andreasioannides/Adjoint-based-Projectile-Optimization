# Adjoint-based-Projectile-Optimization
This project aims the solution of a constrained time-optimal projectile problem with the Continuous Adjoint method. The optimization is conducted with the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimization. The derivatives of the objective function w.r.t the design variables computed by the adjoint method, are
